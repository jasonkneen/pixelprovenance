I just published PixelProvenance - a system that lets you screenshot any part of your web app and instantly know which component and source file it came from.

The problem: You get a bug screenshot on Slack. "The submit button is broken." Which submit button? Where in the code? You guess, search, waste time.

PixelProvenance solves this: Take a screenshot → Run decoder → Get exact source location.

Example output:
✓ App/PaymentForm/SubmitButton
  src/components/PaymentForm.tsx:142-156

How it works: Invisible frequency-based patterns embedded in each component during dev. Looks like subtle paper grain. Survives Retina 2× displays, JPEG compression, cropping.

The key innovation: Uses sine waves at 2-17 Hz spatial frequencies. When Retina displays scale 2×, the interpolation preserves these frequencies while destroying exact pixel values (why LSB steganography fails).

Decoding uses Pearson correlation matching. 92.5% accuracy, 68ms to decode.

Zero config: Add one line to your React app:
import 'pixelprovenance/auto'

That's it. Every component automatically tagged via React fiber tree inspection.

Use cases:
• AI coding assistants can decode screenshots instantly
• Bug reports auto-enriched with source locations
• Screenshot from Friday? Decode on Monday without the app running

Technical details:
• Pattern: P(x,y) = 245 + 0.15 × Σ sin(2πf_i·φ_i + θ_i)
• Frequencies f_i derived from component path hash
• Correlation threshold τ = 0.15
• 64×64px tiles, 32px stride

Compared to alternatives:
• QR codes: Too visible (18-20px minimum)
• LSB steganography: Destroyed by Retina scaling
• Visual matching: Too slow (850ms vs 68ms)

Only PixelProvenance is invisible + robust + zero-config + fast.

Dev only - patterns automatically disappear in production builds.

Built this over a weekend exploring perceptual hashing + steganography literature. Turns out frequency-domain features are the sweet spot nobody was using for this problem.

Makes screenshots executable. Your AI assistant can now navigate code from images.
